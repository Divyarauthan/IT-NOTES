 <h3>About Mobile-Computing:</h3><p>the concept of wireless communication technologs and the proliferation of portable computing devices have made 
     possible a mobile computing era in which users. on the move,can seamlrssly access network services and resources, from anywhare and at anytime 
     .this course provides an Introduction to the fundamentals of mobile computing. A background in computer network and wireless communication is 
     required.
 <h3>Introduction to mobile-computing:</h3><p>Mobile computing is a technology by which users can transmit data,voice,and video through a mobile 
     or any other wireless device.<br>In other word ,"Mobile-Computing is a technology that is used to transmit data through a mobile device over 
     a wireless network."
     <p>In general,mobile computing is seen as a technology used in smartphones,but it is a much bigger topic because it is not limited to smartphones,
         it is used in every device that supports mobility.Such as:-laptop,smart watch,tablet etc.
     </p>
     There are three main concepts of mobile computing on which it is based:-
     <ol><li>Mobile communication</li>
        <li>Mobile hardware</li>
    <li>Mobile software</li>
    </ol>
 </p>
 <h4>Mobile communication:</h4><p>Here mobile communication refers to an infrastructure that provides relible and hassle-free communication for 
     wireless device.<br>
     It includes the protocols,services,bandwidth and portals that the devices support.<br>The Data format is also defined within this,ensuring that 
     there is no collision with other systems.<br>
     Radio wave infrastructure is used in mobile, in which signals are sent over the air (ie the sending and receiving of signals is through the air. )

 </p>
 <h4>Mobile hardware:</h4><p>Mobile hardware means those devices or mobile devices that can receive or access the service of mobilit.It include 
     laptops,smartphones,tablet PCs,smart watches and other personal digital assistants (PDAs).<br>A receptor is installed inside these devices
     which is designed to sense and receive signals.And this device works on 'full duplex'i.e it can also send and receive signals at the same time
     <br>Mobile hardware works over a wireless network.
 </p>
 <h4>Mobile software:</h4><p>Mobile software is program that runs on mobile hardware.It can also be called 'Operating system'of mobile.<br>
It remains responsible for all the function inside the device.It is also called the engine of the device.<br>
It looks after all the features and requirements of mobile application.It provides features like camera,music player,cellular connectivity,
Wi-Fi,Bluetooth,voice recorder,speech recognition,and video player.</p>
