     <h3>Advantages of Animation:</h3>
     <p>
         <h4>Skill and ability Improvement:</h4>
         <p>
        Intractive animation makes it easy for children and adults to understand complex and diffcult things easily in a very short time.Along 
        with this ,it also helps in increasing their skills and ability.
         </p>
         <h4>Intractivity:</h4><p>
             Intractivity is a type of mutual action between the learner, the learner, the learning system,and the learning material.Learners can 
             learn very quickly and in a fast way by watching these intractive videos,in which audio and video are used.  
         </p>
        <h4>Engagement is high:</h4>
        <p>
            Intractive learning,which consists of live-action animation,simulation,video,audio,graphics,feedback,expert advice,and question and answers,
            creates interest in learners,due to which they engage more and watch things.
        </p>
        <h4>Flexibility and Safety:</h4>
        <p>Many things are quite dangerous such as real-life learning experiments that happen in physics and chemistry.Computer animation has been a 
            good choice for all these:
            <ul>
                <li>Many experiments cannot be done in the workplace due to being more dangerous,but animated videos can be used to understand them.</li>
                <li>Animation program can represent many such dangerous events without any hazards. </li>
                <li>If a learner also makes a mistake or does not understand something,them he can repeat that experiment without getting injured.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>motivation:</h4>
        <p>Since animation can be explained to people in a very inspring and interactive way,this is a better way to motivate people.</p>
        <h4>Eliminates Frustration:</h4>
        <p>Computer animation is so attractive that even difficult and complex things can be easily understood.This does not create any frustration 
            in the mind of the learner.
        </p>
        <h4>Practically:</h4>
        <p>It is capable of presenting true-to-life situations that learners face every day.Adults are mostly practical learners-which means that 
            they learn better by facing a real problem than them.<br/>
            Computer animation also allows learners to learn by learn-by-viewing,learn-by-doing and learn-by-coaching.
        </p>
        <h4>Consistent:</h4><p>All learners learn the same principle and skills.these help them to understand things in an organized way.</p>
       <p>in this you can see such processes and things which are not possible to be shown practically. For example geological events such as 
           eathqukes or erosion patterns.
       </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Disadvantages of animation:</h3><p>along with the advantages of all technology,there are also some disadvantages .So let's know
            about them further.
           <p><b>1.</b> Some information is often lost in real-life learning animation program.The learner cannot practically learn things completely. </p>
           <p><b>2.</b>Computer animation programs may function properly from a technical point of view,but fitting them into the curriculum is not that easy.</p>
<p><b>3.</b>To impliment computer animation properly,teachers must have some experience in programming technology.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> It requires extensive memory  and storage  space to store these animation.</p>
         <p><b>5.</b>To play these animation properly,special equipment is required,which sometimes becomes more expensive.</p>
