        <h3>Animation:</h3>
        <p>It is a type of process in which designing,drawing,making layouts and preparation of photographic sequences are the main ones which are the integrated into multimedia
            or any gaming products.Talking about its principle,than still images are exploited and managed in such a way that the illusion  of its movement  is created.In order
            to create the illusion of motion,those images are displayed very quickly and these  images are very rarely different from each other. When we see these still images 
            continuouasly in a sequence,than we feel like a video animation in which characters or objects are moving.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Modern entertainment industry such as film and television has attained great heights because these three filds:
            <b>Animation,Graphics and Multimedia </b>have made a lot of advancement in their field.<br/>
            For example, television advertisements,cartoons serials,presentation and model designs - animation and multimedia techniques have been used in all
            these things.

        <h3>Types of animation:</h3>
        <p>
            There are many different types of animation.But here will known about some important types only.<br/><br/>
            <b>1.Traditional(cel)animation(cel animation or hand-drawn animation)</b><br/>
            <b>2.Stop-motion animation (claymation,cut-outs)</b><br/>
            <b>3.Motion graphics (technology, animated logo)</b><br/>
            <b>4.Computer animation<ul>
                <li>2D animation</li>
                <li>3D animation</li>
                <li>VFX</li>
</ul>
            </b>
            <h4>1.Cel Animation:</h4>
            <p>Cel animation is a type of traditional animation which is done by hand drawings.In this process many pictures are created which are 
                very little different from  each other but they are nature wise prograssive.Due to this prograssive nature, they are used to represent
                some action.A transparent sheet was used to trace these drawings.This transparent sheet is called cel and it is a kind of medium to draw
                the frames.To make the cel animations more atractive in current times, the drawings are accompanied by music,matching sound effect and 
                correct timing ids used for each effect.<br/> For example in a cartoon show, 10-12 frames are played with rapid succession per second to 
                provid a movement to that cel animation.
              </p>
                <h4>2.Stop Animation:</h4>
            
            <p>
                Stop animation or Stop motion animation is a type of technique that allows objects to move on their own. In this some images are drawn 
                in different positions and they are photographed separately.Pupperty is very prominent frame-to-frame animation type.Some Hollywood movies 
                that have been animated via stop-motion effects are king kong , The Dinosaur ,and The Lost World. 
            </p>
          <h4>3.Motion Graohics:</h4>
        <p>
            These motion graohics are pieces of digital footage or animation that create such an illusion in which it seems that they are in illusion
            motion and are also rotating .These are often combined with audio to give better shape and they are used in other multimedia projects.<br>
            These motion graphics are rarely used in animation like that frame-by-frame footage and animation you are using commonly.
            These motion graphics are not used in any story based like typical animation,but they are mostly used in animated abstract shapes and forms 
            such as logos and logo elements.
        </p>
        <h4> 4.Computer Animation:</h4>
        <p>
            Computer animation is a very latest technique which mainly includes three things which are 2D animation,3D animation,VFX.This is not only enhances 
            the hand-drawn characters but also makes them appear real,if we compare it with the earlier animations.
            <ol>
                <li><b>2D Animation:</b> Powerpoint and flash animation are used to do this .Adimttedly, their features are usually similar to cel animation,
                but 2D animation became more popular because scannesd drawings were used in it ,like in cartoon films.A very popular animation software  which 
            is used to make computer 2D animation adobe Flash.</li>
            <li><b>3D Animation:</b> It is used in filmmaking where we need unusual objects or characters which cannot  be easily displayed 
            .For eamaple,using 3D animation , we can make a lot of pepole stand in one place ,set a mountain on top of a table.In this,many 
        different shapes,mathmetical codes are used,actions and colors are displayed which are mind-blowing and it appears that it has been
    copied from an actual picture.Talking about the Best 3D animations software,than Maya,3D Max and Blender are the main ones.</li>
    <li><b>
        VFX:
    </b>
           The short form of Visual Effects is VFX.In this process such imagery is created which is different from live action shoot in 
        any flim making . In VFX,live action footage (special effects) and created imagery (digital effects) are integrated together , making 
    it appear that those environments are completely realistic ,but at the same time terrifying ,valuable.Be impractical and even impossible 
 to capture  in any film.it now uses CGI(Computer Generated Imagery) to make such things. </li>
